            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                The <strong>Automated Prayer Times</strong> app was built to simplify the process of keeping track of daily prayer schedules.
                It automatically retrieves prayer times from your local mosque and delivers them to your email every morning.

            <h2>The General Concept</h2>
            <br>
            <ul>
            <li>Prayer times are scraped from verified mosque websites each day</li>
            <li>A randomised hadith from <strong>Sahih Bukhari</strong> is generated daily</li>
            <li>Emails are formatted with a table containing your city's prayer times and a hadith</li>
            <li>Emails are sent out every morning to subscribed users at 6:30am GMT</li>
            <br>

            <h2>Purpose Of This Project</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                This project was designed as a real-world automation tool in order to exercise my development skills, but more importantly, 
                to benefit the ummah. I saw a real need for this application, and I believe (and hope) that one day it will aid Muslims across 
                the UK in fulfilling their prayers in a country where services such as adhan (public prayer announcement) are not accessible.

            <h2>How I Did It (for those curious)</h2>
            <br>
            <p>This is a very simple, full-stack web application with a communicating front and backend.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>The frontend is hosted on vercel</li>
            <li>The backend is a Python script utilising the Flask framework, hosted on Fly.io</li>
            <li>The script runs indefinitely, and is on a scheduler, constantly checking for time to send</li>
            <li>Once assigned time (6:30am GMT) hits, the script executes and the emails are automatically formatted and sent</li>
            <li>Frontend allows users to subscribe with their email, Backend receives subscriber's email and writes to a subscribers file</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

        <section>
            <h2>Future additions</h2>
            <br>
            <ul>
            <li>Replacing subscribers file for subscribers database</li>
            <li>Configuration for more UK cities, perhaps certain cities in different countries</li>
            <li>Unsubscribe functionality — currently, users must contact me to be manually unsubscribed</li>
            <li>Open to any other suggestions :)</li>
            </ul>
